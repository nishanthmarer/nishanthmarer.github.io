	abstract = {Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is vital for accurately identifying modulation types within incoming signals, a critical task for optimizing operations within edge devices in IoT ecosystems. This paper presents an innovative approach that leverages Transformer networks, initially designed for natural language processing, to address the challenges of efficient AMR. Our Transformer network architecture is designed with the mindset of real-time edge computing on IoT devices. Four tokenization techniques are proposed and explored for creating proper embeddings of RF signals, specifically focusing on overcoming the limitations related to the model size often encountered in IoT scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that our proposed method outperformed advanced deep learning techniques, achieving the highest recognition accuracy. Notably, our model achieved an accuracy of 65.75 on the RML2016 and 65.80 on the CSPB.ML.2018+ dataset.},

  abstract = {Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is an important part of spectrum management. Existing work and datasets focus on variety in the modulations transmitted and only apply rudimentary channel effects. We propose a new dataset which supports AMR tasks which focuses on only a few common modulations but introduces a large variation to the propagation channel. Simple scenarios with rural and urban areas are randomly generated using Simplex noise and a receiver/transmitter pair is placed in the scenario. The 3GPP model is combined with the propagation vector from the scenario generator to simulate a signal propagating across the generated terrain. This dataset brings more realism to the AMR task and will allow machine learning models to adapt to changing environments.},

	abstract = {In the current era of machine learning, there is a growing trend toward leveraging vast amounts of data to train models, relying on the universal function approximator to decipher patterns, make predictions, and drive decisions. In traditional wireless communication systems, only a single view of the received signal is provided to the model, limiting the diversity of perspectives it can exploit. This thesis proposes a novel algorithm that redefines this paradigm by distributing the power of a single input signal or a collection of power values across multiple receivers (Rx). Instead of identical replicas, the received signal power is split equally or unequally among the receivers, introducing distinct variations. This technique enhances the model's ability to interpret and aggregate signal information by leveraging diverse views, resulting in improved classification performance in wireless communication systems. Notably, the inclusion of this algorithm during dataset generation demonstrates significant gains across the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) curve. For instance, performance improvements were observed at -10dB from 0.139 to 0.354, 0dB from 0.399 to 0.795, and +10dB from 0.802 to 0.901 when comparing single to multi-receiver configurations. This work explores, in addition, the optimization of pre-trained models for deployment on efficient, low-power platforms such as NVIDIA Jetson Orin. Models are converted from PyTorch to TensorRT, leveraging inference frameworks to achieve substantial improvements in throughput and significant reductions in latency. These optimizations highlight the practicality and suitability of such approaches for real-time wireless communication scenarios. To set the foundations for the next leap in accuracy, this thesis introduces the concept of incorporating symbol awareness into the Machine Learning (ML) model. A systematic evaluation of model architectures, including extensive hyperparameter searches for vision transformer models, was conducted. While promising architectures were identified, complexity considerations led to the adoption of the Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) as a viable candidate. This work establishes a foundation for incorporating symbol-length awareness in future iterations, with the goal of further improving model performance.--Author's abstract},
