I am currently a Research Assistant in the [Embedded System Laboratory](https://www.nuesl.org/) at Northeastern University, working under the guidance of Prof. Gunar Schirner. I hold a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern University, where my thesis focused on real-world deployable radio-frequency machine learning for modulation recognition.

## Areas of Expertise

- **Digital Twin Development** for analog processors to assess ML model stability
- **Deep Learning** frameworks including PyTorch and TensorFlow with distributed training pipelines
- **Edge Device Optimization** for high-performance inference on embedded platforms
- **Algorithm Design** for communications systems and terrain-augmented channel models
- **Software Engineering** with experience in C/C++, Python, and design pattern methodologies

My work has been published in respected venues including Proceedings of SPIE and MDPI IoT as a co-author on papers addressing terrain-augmented channel models and transformer-based approaches for communication systems. Prior to my academic research, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer (C++ Developer) at Siemens in the Smart Grid Infrastructure (SGI) R&D team, where I filed a patent for an ML algorithm optimizing numerical solvers and additionally mentored interns.

I bring a unique blend of research expertise and practical implementation ability to technical challenges. My background combines academic research with software engineering experience, offering a valuable perspective on translating advanced concepts into effective solutions.

I am currently open to new opportunities to apply my expertise in machine learning and embedded systems in innovative industry settings. Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
